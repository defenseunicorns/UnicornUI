      >But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing
      the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this
      information. Admiral Ackbar, please. You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon
      of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death
      Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is
      generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack
      is to be attempted.
